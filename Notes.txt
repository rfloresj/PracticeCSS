CSS is the language we use to style an HTML document.

What is CSS?
CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets
CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media
CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once
External stylesheets are stored in CSS files

--CSS Syntax--

A CSS rule consists of a selector and a declaration block.

The selector points to the HTML element you want to style.
The declaration block contains one or more declarations separated by semicolons.
Each declaration includes a CSS property name and a value, separated by a colon.
Multiple CSS declarations are separated with semicolons, and declaration blocks are surrounded by curly braces.

In this example all <p> elements will be center-aligned, with a red text color:

p {
  color: red;
  text-align: center;
}

--CSS Selectors--

CSS selectors are used to "find" (or select) the HTML elements you want to style.

We can divide CSS selectors into five categories:

Simple selectors (select elements based on name, id, class)
Combinator selectors (select elements based on a specific relationship between them)
Pseudo-class selectors (select elements based on a certain state)
Pseudo-elements selectors (select and style a part of an element)
Attribute selectors (select elements based on an attribute or attribute value)
This page will explain the most basic CSS selectors.

The CSS element Selector
The element selector selects HTML elements based on the element name.

Example
Here, all <p> elements on the page will be center-aligned, with a red text color: 

p {
  text-align: center;
  color: red;
}

The CSS id Selector
The id selector uses the id attribute of an HTML element to select a specific element.
The id of an element is unique within a page, so the id selector is used to select one unique element!
To select an element with a specific id, write a hash (#) character, followed by the id of the element.

he CSS rule below will be applied to the HTML element with id="para1": 

#para1 {
  text-align: center;
  color: red;
}

The CSS class Selector
The class selector selects HTML elements with a specific class attribute.
To select elements with a specific class, write a period (.) character, followed by the class name.

In this example all HTML elements with class="center" will be red and center-aligned: 

.center {
  text-align: center;
  color: red;
}

You can also specify that only specific HTML elements should be affected by a class.

Example
In this example only <p> elements with class="center" will be red and center-aligned: 

p.center {
  text-align: center;
  color: red;
}

HTML elements can also refer to more than one class.

In this example the <p> element will be styled according to class="center" and to class="large": 

<p class="center large">This paragraph refers to two classes.</p>

The CSS Universal Selector

The universal selector (*) selects all HTML elements on the page.

Example
The CSS rule below will affect every HTML element on the page: 

* {
  text-align: center;
  color: blue;
}

The CSS Grouping Selector

The grouping selector selects all the HTML elements with the same style definitions.

Look at the following CSS code (the h1, h2, and p elements have the same style definitions):

h1 {
  text-align: center;
  color: red;
}

h2 {
  text-align: center;
  color: red;
}

p {
  text-align: center;
  color: red;
}

It will be better to group the selectors, to minimize the code.

To group selectors, separate each selector with a comma.

Example
In this example we have grouped the selectors from the code above: 

h1, h2, p {
  text-align: center;
  color: red;
}

--How To Add CSS--

Three Ways to Insert CSS
There are three ways of inserting a style sheet:

External CSS
Internal CSS
Inline CSS

External CSS

With an external style sheet, you can change the look of an entire website by changing just one file!

Each HTML page must include a reference to the external style sheet file inside the <link> element, inside the head section.

Example
External styles are defined within the <link> element, inside the <head> section of an HTML page:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="mystyle.css">
</head>
<body>

<h1>This is a heading</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>

An external style sheet can be written in any text editor, and must be saved with a .css extension.

The external .css file should not contain any HTML tags.

Here is how the "mystyle.css" file looks:

"mystyle.css"
body {
  background-color: lightblue;
}

h1 {
  color: navy;
  margin-left: 20px;
}

Note: Do not add a space between the property value and the unit:
Incorrect (space): margin-left: 20 px;
Correct (nospace): margin-left: 20px;

Internal CSS
An internal style sheet may be used if one single HTML page has a unique style.

The internal style is defined inside the <style> element, inside the head section.


Example
Internal styles are defined within the <style> element, inside the <head> section of an HTML page:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
body {
  background-color: linen;
}

h1 {
  color: maroon;
  margin-left: 40px;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<h1>This is a heading</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>

Inline CSS
An inline style may be used to apply a unique style for a single element.

To use inline styles, add the style attribute to the relevant element. The style attribute can contain any CSS property.

Inline styles are defined within the "style" attribute of the relevant element:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h1 style="color:blue;text-align:center;">This is a heading</h1>
<p style="color:red;">This is a paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>

Tip: An inline style loses many of the advantages of a style sheet (by mixing content with presentation).
Use this method sparingly.

Multiple Style Sheets
If some properties have been defined for the same selector (element) in different style sheets, 
the value from the last read style sheet will be used.

Assume that an external style sheet has the following style for the <h1> element:

h1 {
  color: navy;
}
Then, assume that an internal style sheet also has the following style for the <h1> element:

h1 {
  color: orange;   
}
Example
If the internal style is defined after the link to the external style sheet, the <h1> elements will be "orange":

<head>
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="mystyle.css">
<style>
h1 {
  color: orange;
}
</style>
</head>

Cascading Order

What style will be used when there is more than one style specified for an HTML element?

All the styles in a page will "cascade" into a new "virtual" style sheet by the following rules, where number one has the highest priority:

1. Inline style (inside an HTML element)
2. External and internal style sheets (in the head section)
3. Browser default
So, an inline style has the highest priority, and will override external and internal styles and browser defaults.

CSS Comments

CSS comments are not displayed in the browser, but they can help document your source code.

Comments are used to explain the code, and may help when you edit the source code at a later date.

Comments are ignored by browsers.

A CSS comment is placed inside the <style> element, and starts with /* and ends with */:

/* This is a single-line comment */
p {
  color: red;
}

You can add comments wherever you want in the code:

Example
p {
  color: red;  /* Set text color to red */
}

Comments can also span multiple lines: 

Example
/* This is
a multi-line
comment */

p {
  color: red;
}

HTML and CSS Comments

From the HTML tutorial, you learned that you can add comments to your HTML source by using the <!--...--> syntax.

In the following example, we use a combination of HTML and CSS comments:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
p {
  color: red; /* Set text color to red */
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<h2>My Heading</h2>

<!-- These paragraphs will be red -->
<p>Hello World!</p>
<p>This paragraph is styled with CSS.</p>
<p>CSS comments are not shown in the output.</p>

</body>
</html>

--CSS Colors--

Colors are specified using predefined color names, or RGB, HEX, HSL, RGBA, HSLA values.

CSS Color Names
In CSS, a color can be specified by using a predefined color name:

Tomato, Orange, DodgerBlue, MediumSeaGreen, Gray, Violet...

CSS Background Color

You can set the background color for HTML elements:

<h1 style="background-color:DodgerBlue;">Hello World</h1>
<p style="background-color:Tomato;">Lorem ipsum...</p>

CSS Text Color

You can set the color of text:

Example
<h1 style="color:Tomato;">Hello World</h1>
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">Lorem ipsum...</p>
<p style="color:MediumSeaGreen;">Ut wisi enim...</p>

CSS Border Color

You can set the color of borders:

Example
<h1 style="border:2px solid Tomato;">Hello World</h1>
<h1 style="border:2px solid DodgerBlue;">Hello World</h1>
<h1 style="border:2px solid Violet;">Hello World</h1>

CSS Color Values

In CSS, colors can also be specified using RGB values, HEX values, HSL values, RGBA values, and HSLA values:

Same as color name "Tomato":

rgb(255, 99, 71)
#ff6347
hsl(9, 100%, 64%)

Same as color name "Tomato", but 50% transparent:

rgba(255, 99, 71, 0.5)
hsla(9, 100%, 64%, 0.5)

<h1 style="background-color:rgb(255, 99, 71);">...</h1>
<h1 style="background-color:#ff6347;">...</h1>
<h1 style="background-color:hsl(9, 100%, 64%);">...</h1>

<h1 style="background-color:rgba(255, 99, 71, 0.5);">...</h1>
<h1 style="background-color:hsla(9, 100%, 64%, 0.5);">...</h1>

--CSS RGB Colors--

An RGB color value represents RED, GREEN, and BLUE light sources.

RGB Value
In CSS, a color can be specified as an RGB value, using this formula:

rgb(red, green, blue)

Each parameter (red, green, and blue) defines the intensity of the color between 0 and 255.

For example, rgb(255, 0, 0) is displayed as red, because red is set to its highest value (255) and the others are set to 0.

To display black, set all color parameters to 0, like this: rgb(0, 0, 0).

To display white, set all color parameters to 255, like this: rgb(255, 255, 255).

Shades of gray are often defined using equal values for all the 3 light sources:

rgb(90, 90, 90), rgb(120, 120, 120), rgb(210, 210, 210)

RGBA Value
RGBA color values are an extension of RGB color values with an alpha channel - which specifies the opacity for a color.

An RGBA color value is specified with:

rgba(red, green, blue, alpha)

The alpha parameter is a number between 0.0 (fully transparent) and 1.0 (not transparent at all):

rgba(255, 99, 71, 0.5)

--CSS HEX Colors--

A hexadecimal color is specified with: #RRGGBB, where the RR (red), GG (green) and BB (blue) hexadecimal integers specify the components of the color.

HEX Value
In CSS, a color can be specified using a hexadecimal value in the form:

#rrggbb

Where rr (red), gg (green) and bb (blue) are hexadecimal values between 00 and ff (same as decimal 0-255).

For example, #ff0000 is displayed as red, because red is set to its highest value (ff) and the others are set to the lowest value (00).

To display black, set all values to 00, like this: #000000.

To display white, set all values to ff, like this: #ffffff.  

*Shades of gray are often defined using equal values for all the 3 light sources:

Example
#3c3c3c
#616161
#787878
#b4b4b4
#f0f0f0
#f9f9f9

--3 Digit HEX Value--

Sometimes you will see a 3-digit hex code in the CSS source.

The 3-digit hex code is a shorthand for some 6-digit hex codes.

The 3-digit hex code has the following form:

#rgb

Where r, g, and b represent the red, green, and blue components with values between 0 and f.

The 3-digit hex code can only be used when both the values (RR, GG, and BB) are the same for each component. So, if we have #ff00cc, it can be written like this: #f0c.

Here is an example:

Example
body {
  background-color: #fc9; /* same as #ffcc99 */
}

h1 {
  color: #f0f; /* same as #ff00ff */
}

p {
  color: #b58; /* same as #bb5588 */
}

--CSS HSL Colors--

HSL stands for hue, saturation, and lightness.

HSL Value
In CSS, a color can be specified using hue, saturation, and lightness (HSL) in the form:

hsl(hue, saturation, lightness)

Hue is a degree on the color wheel from 0 to 360. 0 is red, 120 is green, and 240 is blue.

Saturation is a percentage value. 0% means a shade of gray, and 100% is the full color.

Lightness is also a percentage. 0% is black, 50% is neither light or dark, 100% is white

Experiment by mixing the HSL values below:

hsl(115, 0%, 0%)

Saturation
Saturation can be described as the intensity of a color.

100% is pure color, no shades of gray.

50% is 50% gray, but you can still see the color.

0% is completely gray; you can no longer see the color.

Lightness
The lightness of a color can be described as how much light you want to give the color, where 0% means no light (black), 
50% means 50% light (neither dark nor light) and 100% means full lightness (white).

Shades of Gray
Shades of gray are often defined by setting the hue and saturation to 0, and adjust the lightness from 0% to 100% to get darker/lighter shades:

hsl(0, 0%, 0%)
hsl(0, 0%, 24%)
hsl(0, 0%, 47%)
hsl(0, 0%, 71%)
hsl(0, 0%, 94%)
hsl(0, 0%, 100%)

HSLA Value
HSLA color values are an extension of HSL color values with an alpha channel - which specifies the opacity for a color.

An HSLA color value is specified with:

hsla(hue, saturation, lightness, alpha)

The alpha parameter is a number between 0.0 (fully transparent) and 1.0 (not transparent at all).

--CSS Backgrounds--

The CSS background properties are used to add background effects for elements.

In these chapters, you will learn about the following CSS background properties:

background-color
background-image
background-repeat
background-attachment
background-position
background (shorthand property)

CSS background-color

The background-color property specifies the background color of an element.

Example
The background color of a page is set like this:

body {
  background-color: lightblue;
}

With CSS, a color is most often specified by:

a valid color name - like "red"
a HEX value - like "#ff0000"
an RGB value - like "rgb(255,0,0)"
Look at CSS Color Values for a complete list of possible color values.

Other Elements
You can set the background color for any HTML elements:

Example
Here, the <h1>, <p>, and <div> elements will have different background colors: 

h1 {
  background-color: green;
}

div {
  background-color: lightblue;
}

p {
  background-color: yellow;
}

Opacity / Transparency

The opacity property specifies the opacity/transparency of an element. It can take a value from 0.0 - 1.0. 
The lower value, the more transparent:

div {
  background-color: green;
  opacity: 0.3;
}

Note: When using the opacity property to add transparency to the background of an element, 
all of its child elements inherit the same transparency. This can make the text inside a fully transparent element hard to read.

Transparency using RGBA
If you do not want to apply opacity to child elements, like in our example above, use RGBA color values. 
The following example sets the opacity for the background color and not the text:

You learned from our CSS Colors Chapter, that you can use RGB as a color value. 
In addition to RGB, you can use an RGB color value with an alpha channel (RGBA) - which specifies the opacity for a color.

An RGBA color value is specified with: rgba(red, green, blue, alpha). The alpha parameter is a number between 0.0 (fully transparent) 
and 1.0 (fully opaque).

div {
  background: rgba(0, 128, 0, 0.3) /* Green background with 30% opacity */
}

--CSS Background Image--

The background-image property specifies an image to use as the background of an element.

By default, the image is repeated so it covers the entire element.

Set the background image for a page: 

body {
  background-image: url("paper.gif");
}

The background image can also be set for specific elements, like the <p> element:

Example
p {
  background-image: url("paper.gif");
}

--CSS Background Image Repeat--

CSS background-repeat
By default, the background-image property repeats an image both horizontally and vertically.

Some images should be repeated only horizontally or vertically, or they will look strange, like this:

Example
body {
  background-image: url("gradient_bg.png");
}
If the image above is repeated only horizontally (background-repeat: repeat-x;), the background will look better:

Example
body {
  background-image: url("gradient_bg.png");
  background-repeat: repeat-x;
}

To repeat an image vertically, set background-repeat: repeat-y;

CSS background-repeat: no-repeat

Showing the background image only once is also specified by the background-repeat property:

Example
Show the background image only once:

body {
  background-image: url("img_tree.png");
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
}

In the example above, the background image is placed in the same place as the text. We want to change the position of the image, 
so that it does not disturb the text too much.

Position the background image in the top-right corner: 

body {
  background-image: url("img_tree.png");
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  background-position: right top;
}

The CSS Background Repeat and Position Properties
Property	Description
background-position	Sets the starting position of a background image
background-repeat	

--CSS Background Attachment--

CSS background-attachment

CSS background-attachment
The background-attachment property specifies whether the background image should scroll or be fixed (will not scroll with the rest of the page):

Example
Specify that the background image should be fixed:

body {
  background-image: url("img_tree.png");
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  background-position: right top;
  background-attachment: fixed;
}

Example
Specify that the background image should scroll with the rest of the page:

body {
  background-image: url("img_tree.png");
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  background-position: right top;
  background-attachment: scroll;
}

The CSS Background Attachment Property
Property	Description
background-attachment	Sets whether a background image is fixed or scrolls with the rest of the page

--CSS Background Shorthand--

To shorten the code, it is also possible to specify all the background properties in one single property. This is called a shorthand property.

Instead of writing:

body {
  background-color: #ffffff;
  background-image: url("img_tree.png");
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  background-position: right top;
}

**You can use the shorthand property background:

Example
Use the shorthand property to set the background properties in one declaration:

body {
  background: #ffffff url("img_tree.png") no-repeat right top;
}

When using the shorthand property the order of the property values is:

background-color
background-image
background-repeat
background-attachment
background-position
It does not matter if one of the property values is missing, as long as the other ones are in this order. 
Note that we do not use the background-attachment property in the examples above, as it does not have a value.d

--CSS Borders--

The CSS border properties allow you to specify the style, width, and color of an element's border.

p.dotted {border-style: dotted;}
p.dashed {border-style: dashed;}
p.solid {border-style: solid;}
p.double {border-style: double;}
p.groove {border-style: groove;}
p.ridge {border-style: ridge;}
p.inset {border-style: inset;}
p.outset {border-style: outset;}
p.none {border-style: none;}
p.hidden {border-style: hidden;}
p.mix {border-style: dotted dashed solid double;}

Note: None of the OTHER CSS border properties (which you will learn more about in the next chapters) will have ANY effect unless the border-style property is set!

--CSS Border Width--

CSS Border Width
The border-width property specifies the width of the four borders.

The width can be set as a specific size (in px, pt, cm, em, etc) 
or by using one of the three pre-defined values: thin, medium, or thick:

Demonstration of the different border widths:

p.one {
  border-style: solid;
  border-width: 5px;
}

p.two {
  border-style: solid;
  border-width: medium;
}

p.three {
  border-style: dotted;
  border-width: 2px;
}

p.four {
  border-style: dotted;
  border-width: thick;
}

Specific Side Widths
The border-width property can have from one to four values 
(for the top border, right border, bottom border, and the left border):

Example
p.one {
  border-style: solid;
  border-width: 5px 20px; /* 5px top and bottom, 20px on the sides */
}

p.two {
  border-style: solid;
  border-width: 20px 5px; /* 20px top and bottom, 5px on the sides */
}

p.three {
  border-style: solid;
  border-width: 25px 10px 4px 35px; /* 25px top, 10px right, 4px bottom and 35px left */
}

--CSS Border Color--

The border-color property is used to set the color of the four borders.

The color can be set by:

name - specify a color name, like "red"
HEX - specify a HEX value, like "#ff0000"
RGB - specify a RGB value, like "rgb(255,0,0)"
HSL - specify a HSL value, like "hsl(0, 100%, 50%)"
transparent
Note: If border-color is not set, it inherits the color of the element.

Example
Demonstration of the different border colors:

p.one {
  border-style: solid;
  border-color: red;
}

p.two {
  border-style: solid;
  border-color: green;
}

p.three {
  border-style: dotted;
  border-color: blue;
}

Specific Side Colors
The border-color property can have from one to four values (for the top border, right border, bottom border, and the left border). 

Example
p.one {
  border-style: solid;
  border-color: red green blue yellow; /* red top, green right, blue bottom and yellow left */
}

HEX Values
The color of the border can also be specified using a hexadecimal value (HEX):

Example
p.one {
  border-style: solid;
  border-color: #ff0000; /* red */
}

RGB Values
Or by using RGB values:

Example
p.one {
  border-style: solid;
  border-color: rgb(255, 0, 0); /* red */
}

HSL Values
You can also use HSL values:

Example
p.one {
  border-style: solid;
  border-color: hsl(0, 100%, 50%); /* red */
}

You can learn more about HEX, RGB and HSL values in our CSS Colors chapters.
